## link_files 

link_files are some config files you should replace on your  system, their filenames indicate where you should put them.

every file in this folder is named by their target path, linked by "-" and all UPPER LETTERS should be replaced by env variables 

for example "HOME-.config-pip-pip.conf" 

first, replace "-" to / and add a"$" before UPPER LETTERS

it becoms "$HOME/config/pip/pip.conf", which is exactly the path you shold put it to.
